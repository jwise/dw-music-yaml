  <p>Yes, it's that time of year again: a little late, but it's the musical
  year in review for 2017.  There was a handful of really good stuff this
  year, and a few albums that I was really excited about!  This year, I made
  some changes: I've added a relative and subjective rating system, from one
  to five stars.  A one star album is not, necessarily, bad (unless I say it
  is...) -- think of it, really, as how much I am excited about listening to
  something, so one star just might mean that I haven't really found a place
  for it in my regular listening habits.  The more stars, the more I think
  other people will want to listen to it too; to that end, this year, I had
  only one five-star album, but that means that yinz had better go and
  listen to it!</p>
  
  <p>Got it?  Okay, well, let's get started!  This year, I bought 18
  albums, saw 5 live shows, and recommended another additional 18 pieces of
  "extra credit", and here they are:</p>

    <p>Psy.  Dub.  Chill.  Somewhat dark.  Recommend for genre
    aficionados.</p>
    
    <p>I came to this album originally via my boss, oddly enough -- and
    then, from hearing the first track played at Planet Granite, and
    Shazam'ing it.  This is solidly good programming-work music, I think --
    or, perhaps, climbing gym music, too.  I haven't listened to it much
    since I bought it, but I could imagine listening to it in the car on
    longer trips; to be honest, it just hasn't popped to mind as "I should
    listen to this album!".  Part of the problem, I think, is that the first
    track sets a standard that the rest of the album has trouble matching. 
    Regardless, I think that that first track -- <a
    href="http://music.phutureprimitive.com/track/cryogenic-dreams">Cryogenic
    Dreams</a> -- is a pretty accessible tune that a lot of electronic music
    fans will enjoy listening to.  I really enjoy the chill-psy groove to
    it, and it is well worth a listen.</p>

    <p>Indie/alternative rock.  Lightly electronic.  Recommend.</p>
    
    <p>I think it was <user name=knightofstarz site=lj> that recommended
    this to me.  I like it!  You might be familiar with the hard-hitting
    track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryzEU7WAlg">You Don't
    Get Me High Anymore</a> (which had a <a
    href="http://songexploder.net/phantogram">Song Exploder episode about
    it</a>); that was the rare track that got the crossover of a bunch of
    airplay on (at least) Bay Area radio stations, and also a handful of
    airplay at <a href="http://www.deathguild.com">Death Guild</a>.  It's a
    solidly good tune, that is both musically rich, and catchy, and it might
    be maybe the most representative of the album.</p>
    
    <p>There are other things to be said about this album, though.  Although
    it's a duo, they don't fall into the trap of having only one vocalist,
    and so it's nice to hear the alternation of voices.  The album is also
    pretty short, clocking in at only 36 minutes, which is perhaps a
    blessing and a curse: it seems like you want a little more of it, but on
    the other hand, it does not belabor the point it tries to make about its
    style, and so you don't get sick of it halfway through the album.  (Some
    of the albums I'll review from later in the year have this problem.)
    This is a good thing, because some of the material can be challenging;
    <i>Answer</i>, for instance, is musically nontrivial, and <i>Barking
    Dog</i> is perhaps in a class of its own on the album in terms of
    subject matter.  The album, in many regards, is very rich.</p>
    
    <p><i>You Don't Get Me High Anymore</i>, above, is a great, maybe
    representative, sample of this album.  But for my money, I think that <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcS6MA9fu-I">Same Old Blues</a> is
    a standout track: it's punchy and effective, and shows the wide range of
    musical talent that Phantogram has, from electronic effects to funk- and
    blues-inspired songwriting.</p>

    <p>Uptempo psytrance.  Uh, Infected Mushroom.</p>
    
    <p>There's a new Mushroom album out this year!  I bought it, but it
    doesn't really stick out much in my head.  I went to take a spin through
    some of the tracks to remind myself of it, and some of them don't
    register at all for me -- they kind of sound like generic Mushroom. 
    This could be a good thing or a bad thing; after all, when <i>Legend of
    the Black Shawarma</i> came out, I originally panned it, thinking that
    it was too much of "generic Mushroom"; but these days, I think that
    <i>Black Shawarma</i> is actually quite a good album indeed.  All that
    said, if I find myself reaching for newer Mushroom these days, I
    probably end up with 2015's <i>Converting Vegetarians II</i>.</p>
    
    <p>I probably owe it to myself to listen to this again.  But in the mean
    time, I think that <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJTzwei0VWQ">Groove Attack</a> is
    decently representative of what you'll get on this.</p>

    <p>Drum &amp; bass, verging on somewhat oldskool feeling.  Dancy! 
    Uplifting.  Recommend for genre fans (especially people who used to like
    Pendulum, back when they made D&amp;B).</p>
    
    <p>I really like this album.  It's up-tempo, dancy, and often uplifting. 
    I alluded to this being like Pendulum's work, and I think that
    musically, they're very similar: the drum sequences and samples often
    have the same two-measure semi-syncopated "kick, SNARE, kickSNARE"
    pattern, for instance.</p>
    
    <p>But just as this album is stylistically similar to some of Pendulum's
    work, I argue that its high points show at least as much talent as some
    of Pendulum's high points, if not more.  For instance, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzz-kLEdPyc">Bird of Paradise</a>
    seems like the track in which Netsky truly argues the case for his own
    musicianship, and it is <i>really</i> good.  The closest basis for
    comparison that I have, interestingly, is maybe Infected Mushroom's
    <i>Dancing With Kadafi</i>.  The track is tastefully executed, and
    executes admirable restraint; despite being at 170+bpm, and getting into
    some fairly heavy drum breaks, every time you expect the track to
    descend into noise, Netsky manages to reign it in.  It is masterfully
    artistic, and the first time I heard it, I was in awe.</p>
    
    <p>All that said, this may not necessarily be true about the entire
    album -- and that might be an OK thing, too.  I will call brief
    attention to <i>TNT</i>, a track featuring Chromeo, which made me laugh
    for the entire 3 minutes and 41 seconds.  But I'll refer to my writing
    on my first listen through, when I said that the track that I had on
    repeat was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3SbnrdqJyg">High
    Alert</a>.  I noted that the track was, musically, a "total garbage
    track, but the amazing thing is that I totally love it".  Technically,
    it's terrible: it's boring verse-chorus-verse-chorus; the lyrics are
    overwrought; the chord progression is uninspiring (and even not as
    uplifting as it could be); and the melody on the vocals is almost
    critically dumb.  But that's the thing: I... well, sometimes, I like
    overwrought lyrics that are really easily comprehensible in the emotion
    that they convey.  I like VNV, right?  And this track is basically the
    uplifting version of VNV, and so it got a lot of airplay from me.</p>
    
    <p>If I had to pick one track that might be a good balance between
    Netsky's musicianship and his ability to write stupid, catchy, tunes, it
    might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyA8EQxVGwY">Work It
    Out</a>.  But you owe it to yourself to listen to <i>Bird of
    Paradise</i> and <i>High Alert</i>, too, both above.</p>

    <p>Drum &amp; bass.</p>
    
    <p>I like this album a little less than <i>3</i>, above, which is why
    I'm writing a little less about it than <i>3</i>.  On the other hand,
    Josiah likes it more than <i>3</i>, so there's two different opinions. 
    I think this album overstays its welcome a little bit, even not counting
    the bonus tracks.  But it has a lot of the same magic that Netsky brings
    in his later album, maybe with a little bit less refinement.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-7z5X0ATEc">The Whistle
    Song</a> is insanely uplifting and dancy; I double dare you to listen to
    it without dancing wherever you're listening.  On the other hand, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKahYTAQS7o">No Beginning</a> is
    Netsky's opportunity to show off his musicianship on this album, with a
    beautifully complex drum loop from <a
    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pendulum/comments/4n20ck/drums_on_netskys_no_beginning_are_none_other_than/">Pendulum's
    KJ Sawka</a>.</p>

    <p>Jazz, blues, guitar.  Recommend for Johnny A. completionists;
    everyone else should buy <i>Sometime Tuesday Morning</i> instead.</p>
    
    <p>I know that I said "recommend for completionists".  This is not a bad
    album.  Here's the thing: Johnny A. is a very talented guitarist, and
    I'm glad to hear him writing some on his own, but -- well, if I'm being
    honest, I think a lot of his best work is putting his own (again,
    incredibly talented!) spin on other people's standards.  Nothing on this
    album is bad, but the percentage of things that really stood out to me
    was kind of small.  (I think that this album was mastered kind of hot,
    anyway, which maybe took away some of the "punch" from previous albums,
    too.)</p>
    
    <p>So what I'm saying is, you should listen to <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YowB48BLrA">The Night I Said
    Goodbye</a>.  And if you liked it (which, of course, you will, because
    you have good taste, after all), then you should go buy his first album,
    <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Sometime-Tuesday-Morning-Johnny/dp/B00005JJ04">Sometime
    Tuesday Morning</a>.</p>

    <p>Downtempo.  Chill.  Electronica.  Almost, but not quite, ambient. 
    Recommend if you like that kind of thing.</p>
    
    <p>I actually really like this album, but I'm not convinced it's
    terribly accessible.  I reach for it in special situations, but not all
    the time.  If I'm putting away a lot of miles -- be it behind the wheel,
    or out for a hike, or churning away tarmac beneath my pedals -- I find
    that I end up looking for this album.  If you know that you like Tycho,
    you will like this album.</p>
    
    <p>I think I bought this album after hearing a live set from Tycho at
    Coachella on SiriusXM.  Impressive -- even more impressive after you
    hear what he does on the album -- is that the vast majority of the
    instrumentation that they play on the album, they can also play live. 
    So, as much as you expect this genre to be "laptop music", Tycho is
    really quite talented.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a link to
    listen to that set, but <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zil3A20KC4">here's a close enough
    analogue</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Representative from this album, I think, is the opening track, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg_rZhpMuWA">Glider</a>.  To be
    honest, though, I would be remiss when mentioning Tycho to an audience
    that may not know him if I did not also link the <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APXjAiWGe4s">title track from his
    previous album, Awake</a>, which I think most people would instead know
    as being "the Tycho song".</p>

    <p>Industrial.  Like, really, really, really industrial.  Recommend for
    industrial fans.</p>
    
    <p>Rhys Fulber is an artist that you may know, if you like the kind of
    music that I like.  He is half of Delerium (the other half being Bill
    Leeb), and also, the mastermind behind his non-self-named solo project,
    Conjure One.  (He's been involved in Front Line Assembly, too.) I really
    like Delerium, and I really like Conjure One.  This, then, is his first
    self-named solo project.  It's dramatically different from the lighter
    Delerium and Conjure One work, being heavily dark and rhythm-driven. 
    The first track, <i>Effigy</i>, makes no bones about what it is, placing
    you solidly into the beating heart of the machine, with changing
    soundscapes and spoken vocal samples as the track progresses.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to listen to something that's unlike the vast majority of
    things you'll listen to this year, you should give <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFzqMI7Cq90">Effigy</a> a spin. 
    After all, the worst that could happen is that you decide you don't like
    it -- and in the best case, you have found a new genre of music to
    love!</p>

    <p>Electronic; alternative pop; atmospheric; a little dark. 
    Recommend.</p>
    
    <p>This is a good album that overstays its welcome by about five tracks,
    I think.  It starts with this wonderful combination of an atmospheric
    track, a memorable single (<i>Colours</i>), and a driving collection of
    harmonies (<i>Miss You Paradise</i>), which are all musically
    interesting.  <i>Foolish Boy</i> has a hi-hat pattern at the beginning
    of it that reminds me of the drum sequencing in Delerium's <i>Stay</i>
    (off of last year's <i>Mythologie</i>), and, really, the entire album
    isn't too far from that general idea, in sound.  Eventually, the sound
    in the album loses its luster, and I find myself fatigued with it.</p>
    
    <p>All that said about the content of the album, it's probably worth
    putting it into context.  We were used to Emma Hewitt solely as guest
    vocals, on other people's albums: Dash Berlin's <i>Waiting</i>, and then
    <i>Disarm Yourself</i>.  And this betrays something of a pattern in
    dance music: it is way more common, as far as I can tell, for women to
    be named after the "featuring", rather than as the album artist.  So,
    more than anything else, it's a refreshing change for Emma Hewitt to
    have "first author" credit, as it were, and reminds me that I should
    also check out Betsie Larkin's solo effort, <i>All We Have Is
    Now</i>.</p>
    
    <p>So even notwithstanding my complaint that this album would be better
    suited at the length of <i>Three</i>, above, the part of the album that
    comes before I get tired of it is, alone, worth the purchase.  Have a
    listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfj8d36qrk8">Miss You
    Paradise</a>, and enjoy Emma Hewitt's ability to use her voice both as
    lyrical conveyance and as harmonizing instrument to set a soundscape.</p>

    <p>Funk.  Yes, it's more Jamiroquai!</p>
    
    <p>I gave this a kind of low rating, but realistically, it's because I
    never really had cause to rate it higher.  I think I listened to it once
    at work and once on my bike.  Listening to it now, I really like the
    first track, <i>Shake It On</i>, but I seem to remember that the rest of
    the album was not as much my jam.  The title track, <i>Automaton</i> is
    commendable inasmuch as it's a good experiment, but I'm not sure I'm
    really in love with it.  Fundamentally, I think the problem with this
    album is that there isn't a place where I would listen to this; it
    doesn't fit in with any of the places I usually listen to music.</p>
    
    <p>All that told, I think that <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlmOk4ubcU">the title track,
    Automaton</a> is a good sense of what this album is all about, and you
    wouldn't do badly to listen to it.  And, if you like the opening track,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Yc02Z7iic">Shake It On</a>,
    you might really like some of Jay Kay's earlier work -- <i>Dynamite</i>
    is a great album that's well worth listening to.</p>

    <p>Alex Reed, in a genre of his own.  Post-industrial funk, if you have
    to label it.  Recommend for Alex Reed fans.</p>
    
    <p>This time, Alex took an almost funk-like direction, as he produced a
    concept album flowing from track to track.  This is a challenging album:
    as usual, there is a good deal of the "Alex is smarter than you" going
    on, as he speaks in metaphor deeper than my little mind is capable of
    putting together.  There were a handful of memorable tracks on the LP:
    <i>Stranger</i> is something that I quite enjoyed, while
    <i>Knowledge</i> takes an almost P-Funk approach to the backing. 
    <i>Talk About Bones</i> would not be out of place on <i>Madness &amp;
    Extinction</i>, and has a catchy beat and melody.</p>
    
    <p>The companion EP, <i>Faceless</i>, is full of a mix of tracks that
    I actually like better than Sol, on the whole.  Stylistically, some of
    it harkens back to the ThouShaltNot era of Alex's work; maybe the most
    true to that is <i>Phantom Limb (Classic Mix)</i>, which has a sound
    almost like an updated version of the sound from the 2003 album <i>The
    White Beyond</i>.  I quite enjoy that track!</p>
    
    <p>Fans of Alex's know what they're getting into with this, I think, but
    in case you're curious, <a
    href="https://seeming.bandcamp.com/track/phantom-limb-classic-mix">Phantom
    Limb (Classic Mix)</a> is probably represntative of the <i>Faceless
    EP</i>, and <a
    href="https://seeming.bandcamp.com/track/knowledge">Knowledge</a> is
    probably your best introduction to the themes presented on
    <i>Sol</i>.</p>

    <p>Rock.  Goth.  Recommend for genre aficionados.</p>
    
    <p>The simple story is this: if you like The Cr&uuml;xshadows, you'll
    like this album; if you don't, you probably won't.  Stylistically, this
    album is pretty similar to <i>Under Your Spell</i>, below, and of the
    two of them, frankly, I like <i>Under Your Spell</i> better.  All that
    said, the opening track (and single), <i>Helios</i> is good listening! 
    But I'm not sure the rest of the album is an hour and three minutes
    worth of interesting.</p>

    <p>Electronic.  Trance.  Chill.  Remixes.</p>
    
    <p>I bought this while I was impatiently awaiting <i>Beyond The
    Lights</i>, below.  If you want slightly chilled -- but not really as
    much slower as you <i>really</i> want -- remixes of some Aly &amp; Fila
    classics, then I guess this is the album for you.  I probably owe it to
    myself to give this album another spin to see if any of it would be
    appropriate to fit in my yoga playlist, but I don't expect any of it to
    be.  It's not a bad album, but I don't love it, and I don't really think
    that the songs had the reimagining that they really deserve for this
    format.</p>

    <p>Trance.</p>
    
    <p>This is an okay album, but fundamentally, there's one problem with it
    -- and that problem is their 2014 album, <i>The Other Shore</i>.  If
    <i>The Other Shore</i> seemed to stay fresh, reinventing itself as it
    progressed, <i>Beyond The Lights</i> seems to fall back on the same two
    or three ideas that it sets out early in the album.  It might be that my
    expectations were unreasonably inflated for this album, and maybe if it
    were not in the shadow (so to speak) of its older sibling, then it would
    stand alone much more readily.  It's not bad, but I keep feeling like I
    did with <i>Mythologie</i> last year, or maybe <i>The Sum Of Its
    Parts</i>: if I want to listen to Aly &amp; Fila, then instead I think
    I'd rather just listen to <i>The Other Shore</i>.</p>
    
    <p>There are good tracks on this album, and it's probably worth one spin
    just to familiarize yourself with them, if you like this kind of thing. 
    The title track, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7o00yd_XJ8">Beyond The
    Lights</a>, hits all the Aly &amp; Fila tropes, including the
    Middle-Eastern melodies, and the trademark Aly &amp; Fila bass drum roll
    about 3/4 of the way through.  But if you only get to listen to one
    track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRdZZccNMYU">Surrender,
    ft. Sue McLaren</a> is what you're lookign for.  (You might remember Sue
    McLaren from <i>Running</i>, off <i>The Other Shore</i>, and her
    performance on this album is at least as uplifting as it was there.)</p>

    <p>Electronica; trance, but not heavy.  Recommended for everyone. 
    <b>Drop what you're doing and buy this album right now.</b></p>
    
    <p>This is the album this year that I didn't even know how much I needed
    until I heard it.  Last year, I bought Chicane's <i>The Sum Of Its
    Parts</i> in the hope of an album in the vein of <i>Behind The Sun</i>;
    this album is the clear spiritual successor that I was looking for.  You
    may remember that The Thrillseekers (Steve Helstrip) did a remix of
    Saltwater that was on <i>Behind The Sun</i>; he hasn't had his own
    full-length artist album, until now.  It has been worth the wait.</p>
    
    <p>Like <i>Behind The Sun</i>, this is an album of something of an
    emotional journey.  Rarely do I feel compelled to quote the promotional
    material for an album, but in this case, I think it's reasonable and
    accurate: &quot;...and that's what this album is all about: escaping
    from it all, and getting lost in the emotions conveyed within
    it.&quot;  The album is expertly crafted to put forth the messages of
    both hope and pain, back and forth, expressing the breadth of the human
    experience.  Lyrically, it is not terribly challenging, but I find that
    the soundscapes that The Thrillseekers create do an incredible job of
    shaping the voyage that you embark on over the course of this album.</p>
    
    <p>You owe it to yourself to just sit down and listen to the whole album
    from start to finish, I think.  Go out for a hike, or a run, and put it
    on your headphones, and get lost in it: just do it.  If you need
    standout tracks, consider the contrast of <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph5GKwpMarU">Love Me For A Day</a>
    with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyR6vwu4w6o">How Will I
    Know</a>.  But don't spoil it for yourself: listen to this album from
    top to bottom.</p>

    <p>Rock, bordering on metal.  Goth.  Recommended for people who like
    that kind of thing -- or those with a sense of adventure.</p>
    
    <p>I really like this album.  It has all the right combinations of
    things that stick music in my mind: both hard electronic sounds, and
    fulfillingly real instrumentation; soundscapes that fill; and infectious
    melodies.  I am not convinced that this is a particularly courageous
    move, musically -- perhaps it's more of a "safe" sound for what TBM
    listeners expect -- but it's very clear about what it's trying to do,
    and it executes that basically flawlessly.  There's enough variety in
    the album that it feels fresh for all 41 minutes; the common sonic
    themes in sounds are present for most of the album, but I don't find
    myself fatigued listening to it.  Tempos vary from the mid-90s all the
    way to mid-150s, which help avoid the perception of "one really long
    song", too.</p>
    
    <p>Often, I find myself singing along in the car, or if I'm on my bike
    working hard, sometimes involuntarily harmonizing with whatever breath I
    have left.  The album feels upbeat and driving most of the way through. 
    For my ears, the best introduction to the album is probably <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgFFAeG5BBQ">One</a>, and if you
    enjoy rock, you should have a listen to it.  (Note that the video mix is
    not exactly identical to the album mix; I like the album mix a little
    better.)</p>

    <p>Uplifting trance.  Recommended for trance aficionados.</p>
    
    <p>This is a solid trance album that I think overstays its welcome by
    about 20 minutes (even not withstanding the remixes on the deluxe
    edition).  The best analogy that I can give is that it's a good
    successor to John O'Callaghan's 2009 <i>Never Fade Away</i> (though, I
    think I liked <i>Never Fade Away</i> better).  This is Craig Connelly's
    first artist album, though, and in this era of fewer and fewer people
    making full-length artist albums, I can't fault anyone for getting out
    there and having a go at it; as I listen to each individual track in
    isolation, I remember why I enjoy this kind of trancey vibe, and I think
    of how much I'd enjoy any of these in the middle of a good DJ set.</p>
    
    <p>This album is at its best when it's at its most uplifting, and I
    think the peak of that is probably <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lngtQPLDWWc">How Can I, ft. 
    Jessica Lawrence</a> -- but, for extra double uplifting points, you
    should really consider, on the bonus album, the <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiFBhe0Wj7E">John O'Callaghan
    remix of the same tune</a>, which is really something else, and made me
    dance in my seat while I listened to it right now.</p>

    <p>Yep, it's another ASOT year mix.  One of the better ones in recent
    memory.</p>
    
    <p>Do you like ASOT year mixes?  This one is pretty good, and I enjoyed
    listening to it, and I could even see myself listening to it again in
    the future -- something I probably haven't said about an ASOT yearmix
    until 2009 or so.  Also, the intro got even more absurd this year, so it
    has that going for it.  One thing that's nice in recent memory is that
    you get full tracks also if you buy the full mixed version on Amazon
    MP3, so if you like anything in particular, you get another 100 or so
    tracks to listen to on your own.</p>

    <p>I didn't mention this above because I only bought this in January,
    but, here, look, let me put it in no uncertain terms: <b>buy this right
    now</b>.  This would have been a strong contender for "best thing I
    listened to this year" if it had met the January 1st deadline.  But,
    basically, all you need to know is that Gabriel &amp; Dresden did their
    first artist album since <i>2006</i>, and it's absolutely fantastic. 
    (Trance-style, if you must know, but musically, it kind of wanders
    around genres, and has the same "everyone should listen" characteristic
    that <i>Escape</i> does.)</p>

    The <i>Hurricane</i> edit is -- to borrow an EDM turn of phrase,
    "massive", and <i>Natural</i> is just a good track.  Basically
    everything that Mat Zo does feels inspired, and even when he shitposts
    on SoundCloud, it is not an exception.</p>

    <p>TR/ST has a new album coming that he's been teasing singles from for the
    past two years.  <i>Bicep</i> is not my favorite thing, but
    <i>Destroyer</i> I think is freaking fantastic, and features a sound
    that's identifiably TR/ST, but otherwise feels fresh and like a complete
    new dimension for him to explore -- a stripped-down sound almost
    reminiscent of Coldplay.  I'm excited for whatever the album brings,
    when it finally lands -- and maybe even more excited for the tour that
    comes with it.</p>

  title: Ari Mason - Musica Lunae

    <p>Last year, I wrote about Ari Mason: "<i>Anyway, I think it's pretty
    clear that she is still developing as an artist, and if this is anything
    to go by, I really look forward to whatever she does next.</i>".  I
    stand by this, but what she did was 100% not what I was expecting.  In
    this case, she decided to cover...  a collection of 16th century motets. 
    She brings her own flavor to them, with an electronic, vocoder-based
    style for the entirety of the album.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to
    make of it, and felt kind of negatively about it, but as the album
    progressed, I realized that the electronically-obscured sound wasn't an
    unintended side effect, so much as it was the entire point of the
    album!</p>
    
    <p>I didn't buy it last year because it wasn't out on Amazon MP3 yet,
    which is where I seem to have centralized my music consumption.  I don't
    know if it will get all that much airplay from me, either.  But I'm
    really excited to see an artist finding her sound, and making such a
    strong statement: "this is what I believe that this genre should draw
    from", and "it's okay to have crosspollination in our influences".  This
    is a gutsy album to release, and I'm so glad that she did it.  I bought
    it in 2018.</p>

    <p>Piano and vocals.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe one of the biggest discoveries that I've made this year is
    Vienna Teng.  I came to her song <i>Harbor</i> from Syncopation's a
    cappella cover of it at Techapella this year, where they did a fantastic
    job navigating the complicated rhythms that build the piece up; and in
    that, really, lies the first hint of what an incredibly talented
    musician that Vienna is.  She pours raw emotion into her work, but on
    the piano and in her writing -- and the amazing thing is that, despite
    the technically challenging music, it doesn't feel contrived in the
    slightest.  The rhythms aren't unusual for the classic "prog rock"
    reason of "because we had to put something weird in there", and the
    writing is not overblown for the sake of being overblown; there's
    something refreshingly honest about all of her work.</p>
    
    <p>The depth of this honesty, I think, comes when you see her live,
    which I only wish that I had.  She does a show around New Year's every
    year, as far as I can tell, and I didn't quite get in on tickets in
    time.  (I won't make that mistake again this year.) She is at least as
    talented of a performer live as she is on an album, and you can tell
    that the performance is truly like second nature to her; she chooses
    songs to play, as far as I can tell, by pulling them out of a hat, and
    because she knows them inside and out, she executes them perfectly. 
    (She did a second night of the show, with a largely different setlist,
    but I haven't listened to that one yet.)</p>
    
    <p>You would do yourself a great service to listen to the recorded
    tracks that I linked above.  Then sit down for two hours and listen to
    her live set.  You won't regret it.  (Then, get tickets to see her as
    soon as you can.)</p>
