  <p>Once again, I'm late on putting this one together, but at least it's
  still Q1 of 2020 (albeit barely...).  It feels like 2019 was a very full
  year, but somehow, it wasn't as full of new musical things as was 2018,
  with only 17 new albums to last year's 22.  There was a lot of generally
  forgettable stuff this year, but there are quite a few things that ended
  up in my playlist over and over!</p>
  
  <p>As usual, here's how this works: the rating system is relative and
  subjective rating system, from one to five stars.  A one star album is
  not, necessarily, bad (unless I say it is...) &mdash; think of it, really, as
  how much I am excited about listening to something, so one star just might
  mean that I haven't really found a place for it in my regular listening
  habits.  The more stars, the more I think other people will want to listen
  to it too &mdash; or, at least, the more I think other people ought to listen
  to it, anyway...!</p>
  
  <p>Got it?  Okay, well, let's get started &mdash; this year, I bought 17
  albums, did 2 things of my own, saw 4 live shows, and recommended
  another additional 26 pieces of "extra credit", and here they all are:</p>

    <p>Electronica, dark synthwave.  Recommend for genre fans.</p>
    
    <p>It's been a while since Ladytron released something new, and I think
    this is a good effort for all that time.  Musically, it is relatively
    diverse (at least, within the genre...), and it is short and sweet and
    to the point, clocking in at just shy of 54 minutes.  The rhythmic
    repetition results in tracks that stick out in my mind, and are
    extremely danceable; many of these fit naturally in a DJ set designed to
    get your body moving, but on the other hand, they seem to work equally
    well at my desk.  If I have to make a complaint, which I do, it's that
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">it's been
    compressed to hell and back</a>, and the percussion -- which I claim is
    driving the album -- gets lost in the muddle.  (You'll hear that a lot
    from me this year, so get used to it.)</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHufYLxIwU8">Deadzone</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shUHbx24hq8">Figurine</a> are two heavily danceable tracks from Ladytron's self-titled.</p>

    <p>Futurepop, rock.  Recommend for Aesthetic Perfection fans.</p>
    
    <p>Over the years, Daniel Graves has gotten a bunch of grief for his
    project, Aesthetic Perfection, having become more "pop"-ish, and less... 
    Industrial, or EBM, or whatever.  The thing is: Daniel Graves never
    really <i>was</i> what those fans wanted him to be!  All along, if you
    kept your ears open, he has always trended towards a more melodic pop
    sound (accompanied by bursts of his trademark screaming, of course).  If
    you look at his history of remixes, you'll see that when given the
    opportunity to enter a remix contest, he enters contests for...  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu0GQz_ziXc">Lady Gaga, and the
    results are amazing</a> (well, amazing, if you like Daniel Graves).  So
    it shouldn't be a surprise when his new album is more pop-heavy, and,
    well, it is.</p>
    
    <p>It's a fine album, but the only thing I have against it is that it's
    just more of the same.  Which is what you expect, but all the same, the
    catchy lick from <i>Supernatural</i> is basically xeroxed from <a
    href="https://aestheticperfection.bandcamp.com/album/never-enough"><i>Never
    Enough</i></a> (2015), which is hard to let slide.  On the other hand,
    the mix is wonderfully punchy, and that goes a long way in my mind.</p>
    
    <p>Have a listen to <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mH-5NrCGEQ">Supernatural</a>,
    which I love, and <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szbTrEoBtwg">Wickedness</a>.</p>

    <p>A variety, including pop, electronica, and ...  whatever you call
    Vienna Teng.  Recommended for most people.</p>
    
    <p>So I'd seen Vienna Teng live in early January, and it seemed like
    <i>Level Up</i> would be "obviously" the right opening for !!Con West. 
    For bonus points, the album is licensed CC-BY, so I had no problems with
    letting it go out over the live stream, too.  I love a lot about this
    album, and a lot of it has stuck with me; I think one of my favorite
    things about Vienna Teng is the variety both of sounds and affects that
    she brings to her albums.  So much of it pops into my head out of
    nowhere from time to time, and the amazing thing is that it's not just
    one or two songs, but a good cross-section of the album!</p>
    
    <p>It's hard to pick one or two favorites, but consider the bookends, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4n_8R5lKnw">Level Up</a> and <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KknieRIBZGs">Goodnight New

    <p>Soft, ambient, a little electric but largely acoustic.  Recommended
    for most people.</p>
    
    <p>Recommended by <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsey">Lindsey
    Kuper</a>, also during !!Con West.  Also great desk music, and I've
    found that it also works well in yoga classes.  It's hard to say much
    about it, but I really really like it: it's a soothing mix of guitar and
    the occasional bleeps and bloops.  Representative from this album, I
    think, is <a

    <p>Gothy massive beats.  Recommended for fans.</p>
    
    <p>It has been <i>years</i> since Robert Alfons released <i>Joyland</i>,
    and in the mean time, he's been dropping singles here and there.  At
    long last, this year, he announced that he'd release a double-album,
    spaced over the year.  The albums were...  fine!  Not every track was a
    massive hit, but they all had his signature sound.  I would say that a
    solid 50% of tracks on this 8-track album were decent, and the rest were
    largely forgettable.</p>
    
    <p>It's not a bad hit rate, but it's not "stop the world, you gotta hear
    this".  One of the better tracks is <a

    <p>Gareth Emery trance.  Gareth Emery completionists can get it,

    <p>Do you like the Gareth Emery song?  (The new one, not the old one. 
    There's only one new one and only one old one, the rest are just
    copies.) If you do, you might like this album, because it has 14 of the
    Gareth Emery song, including one of the standard outro Gareth Emery song
    (my favorite Gareth Emery song).  Listen to <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwPArfEKkII">Lionheart</a>, and if
    you like it, you can get the album.  Or maybe you can still skip the

    <p>Dark and downtempo and sad, jazzy, trip-hop.  If you like that idea,
    stop and buy it.  If not, skip it.</p>
    
    <p>This album will probably be polarizing.  It is challenging because of
    how dark it is.  But all the same, I loved it both musically and
    content-wise.  The sparse sonic landscape and mix of the album matches
    the emotional tone, and I give a lot of credit to the songwriting.  I
    found this album originally because of the Iris remix of Gravity, which
    was crossposted to Andrew Sega's soundcloud; the original has a very
    different tone.  If that all sounds appealing to you, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkZr935WD88">have a listen to
    Gravity</a>.  And if it doesn't, well, I don't blame you.</p>

    <p>Synthpop and darkwave.  Listen to it for almost everyone, buy it for
    fans of the genre.</p>
    
    <p>I'm going to start by getting this out of the way.  The mastering on
    this album is bad.  It's dog shit bad.  The whole album is firewalled,
    and there's so much punchiness in the instrumentation, and the vocals
    are lost in the mix, and I'm so angry about it.  The worst part is that
    the B-sides on the deluxe version aren't like this at all, so you get an
    idea that they are <i>capable</i> of making an album that isn't slammed
    to the limiters!  They just decided not to, for no good reason.</p>
    
    <p>Ok, that's out of the way.  If you put that behind us, I love this
    album.  Andrew Sega's sounds and beats are some of his finest, and
    Reagan Jones's songwriting is on form too (at least, as long as you
    don't mind that form being "slightly less heavyhanded than VNV Nation"). 
    It's a diverse album in terms of sounds, tempos, feelings, ...  it goes
    from the driving opener of Third Strike, ending up in the lush, warm,
    green Final Fate.  It all feels exactly like what it's supposed to be. 
    I just wish you could hear it in the mix.  The fact that it still
    managed a five-star despite the disastrous mix maybe should tell you a
    lot about how much I like it, musically.</p>
    
    <p>Have a listen to <a

    <p>Ambient.</p>
    
    <p>I give Above &amp; Beyond a lot of credit here.  For the past while,
    they've mostly been following trends, and, well...  the results have
    been mediocre.  The world wants them to pump out big rewm houws, and
    they do, and it's ...  not their thing.  <i>Tri-state</i> was such an
    emotionally open album, which felt like it was meaningfully "their
    thing"; over time, it felt like they progressively transitioned to Just
    Turning The Crank On Some Beats.  So although ambient is not necessarily
    <i>my</i> thing, this album feels like it goes back to their roots in a
    lot of ways: it sonically experiments with feelings in a way that most
    of their subsequent stuff simply hasn't done.  (And, in addition, I give
    them a lot of credit for mastering the album with a load of dynamic
    range!)</p>

    <p>Pop.  Nominally drum &amp; bass, but realistically, much more of a
    reggae influence.  Buy this.</p>
    
    <p>I really liked this!  I originally heard it on an EVA Air flight on
    the in-flight entertainment, and I was surprised by how much I liked
    something on the plane.  This is a solid album that also has a great mix
    of tones and feelings to it, all with a great collection of beats and
    vocals.  In my mind, I associate Rudimental with drum &amp; bass, but
    what I've learned from this is that they're capable of much, much more
    -- and that when they bring a variety of guest vocalists on the album,
    you get even more than that still.</p>
    
    <p>One thing that I love about is that it feels like a cohesive album,
    rather than just a collection of songs.  Bonus points for being
    well-mastered and punchy-sounding, too.  It's hard to extract songs in
    isolation, but for a taste of the range of the album, maybe compare the
    massive chorus of <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZVm-2nM0sA">Sun Comes Up</a> with

    <p>Ok, I really like this album, but it's not for everyone.  It has
    moments that are extremely danceable.  The beats are huge; Kanga knows
    what she's going for, and executes to great effect.  It's short and to
    the point, coming in at a 6-track 20-minute EP.  What's not to like?</p>

    This year, I did a very different feeling mixtape.  2019 was a rougher
    year for me than was 2018, it seems, and the songs I chose reflected that.  I don't
    know if this is a thing lots of folks will enjoy, but that's ok.  I
    liked it.

  title: Cabin
  url: https://nyus.joshuawise.com/cabin-comp-2.mp3
  short: |
    Over the December break, I decided I finally wanted to try singing
    again.  Without any real knowledge of composition, I took a crack at
    doing a choral-style cover of a few verses and the chorus of Alexx
    Reed's <a
    href="https://thoushaltnot.bandcamp.com/track/cabin">Cabin</a>.  I don't
    call it polished at all, but I think it's a different view on something
    that I know well, anyway.

  </ul> <p><a name="extra-credit"></a>I also listened to a bunch of music
  that I didn't end up buying -- for some of these, because I didn't really
  want a whole album, and for some of them, because there wasn't a whole
  album to be had (or sometimes, because I forgot).  For <b>extra
  credit</b>, here's a smattering of these things that I wrote down, anyway,
  sorted roughly by category ...  but fair warning, they get weird in a
  hurry:</p><ul>

  title: Mile Twelve - The Margaret Keene
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvHnxctuM0
  short: Bluegrass, via efaust.  I liked it.
-
  title: Jonas Bonnetta - All This Here
  url: https://jonasbonnetta.bandcamp.com/album/all-this-here
  short: Ambient.
-
  title: Infected Mushroom &amp; Tuna ft. A-Wa - Lost In Space
  url: https://music.monstercat.com/track/lost-in-space-2
  short: More Mushroom.  Very catchy.
-
  title: Culture Shock - UKF live set with Sub Focus and Metrik back-to-back
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvFgxEii4Sk
  short: |
    Drum &amp; bass 2hr set.  It's great.  It feels like the old Pendulum
    Essential Mix, if that's your thing.
- 
  title: 3TEETH - PUMPED UP KICKS
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36v6XBpa7CA
  short: Industrial cover of what ought to be an industrial song anyway.
-
  title: Faderhead - Night Physics
  url: https://faderhead.bandcamp.com/album/night-physics
  short: |
    "Noise.  Voices.  Noise.  Silence." almost made it onto my end-of-year
    compilation, and would have, were it not for something that was actually
    released this year...
-
  title: Rhys Fulber - Ostalgia
  url: https://sonicgroove.bandcamp.com/album/ostalgia-sglp06
  short: It was fine, but not my cup of tea, so I didn't buy it.  If you liked "Realism" from a few years ago, it might be worth checking out, though.

  title: Haben Sie ein Telefon?
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLBJDQJz9yw
  short: |
    This post seems to be light on shitpost mashups, so here's an attempt to
    rectify that: this is the Lady Gaga vs.  Rammstein mashup that you have
    been looking for.
- 
  title: Minuit Machine - Empty Shell
  url: https://minuitmachine.bandcamp.com/track/empty-shell
  short: This is a super dancy piece of darkwave, and I wish the rest of the album were as good.
-
  title: Tibetan Incantations - Om Mani Padme Hum
  url: https://soundcloud.com/mysticmedia-001/tibetan-incantations-om-mani
  short: <a href="https://joshua0.dreamwidth.org/71892.html">As seen previously on this blog.</a>

  title: Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music
  url: https://music.ishkur.com
  short: An Internet classic exploring the myriad genres of electronica, from the very beginnings until the present day, has finally been updated.  Good way to waste a few hours.

  </ul> <p><a name="live-music"></a>Finally, I got to see some <b>live shows</b>
  last year.  Here's my rundown of what I saw:</p><ul>

---
type: live
list:
-
  act: Vienna Teng
  where: Freight &amp; Salvage
  date: January 4th
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS1U-b2SgZI
  short: |
    If you get a chance to see Vienna Teng live, you should totally do it. 
    Her sets are fully request-based; in this set, she ...  drew a request
    for the jazz standard, Autumn Leaves, out of a hat, and then thought for
    a moment, and played it from memory.  Who does that?  How?  It's
    amazing.
-
  act: Chicane and 4 Strings
  where: Mezzanine
  date: February 1st
  url: https://mezzaninesf.com/events/chicane-4-strings/
  short: |
    Trance classics!  I might be too old for this.  <a
    href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2wnCgMtqDZnNckgh6">Photos and snaps.</a>
-
  act: Kamasi Washington and Herbie Hancock
  where: Greek Theatre, Berkeley
  date: August 23rd
  url: https://thegreekberkeley.com/events/herbie-hancock-kamasi-washington
  short: |
    This was an incredible show that I am lucky to have seen.  Herbie
    Hancock is a living legend, and Kamasi Washington is not just an
    up-and-coming but now-present total star.  Oddly, their roles were
    reversed in this show: Kamasi Washington did his best to present to us
    the best-in-the-world possible view of "what Jazz is", and Herbie
    Hancock, following him, completely turned our minds inside out with his
    premise of what the future of jazz ought to be.  <a

    videos.</a>

  act: Vienna Teng
  where: Freight &amp; Salvage
  date: December 30th
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7q4HCpdWT4
  short: |
    New-years show.  Vienna Teng continues to impress, even 6 months
    pregnant.  The schedules just happened to land this year that we got two
    in a year.
-
  act: Alex Reed
  where: online
  date: three concerts over the course of the year
  url: https://www.patreon.com/salexanderreed/
  short: |
    Alexx's Patreon continues to surprise and delight.  He has committed to
    doing three live-streamed concerts a year, and I'm goign to list them
    here because they have the same fantastic display of musicianship that
    I'd expect at any other concert.  This year's resulted in a few live
    albums with some of my favorite versions of a bunch of songs that he's
    written; unfortunately, they're Patreon-only, rather than available on
    Bandcamp, so I can't point you to them.  Oh, well.
