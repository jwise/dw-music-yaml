  <p>Hooo boy, I am <i>late</i> on this one this year.  At the beginning of
  2018, I was worried that there wasn't a lot of music that I was excited
  for; I was pleasantly surprised, over the course of the year, to have a
  <b>lot</b> of stuff that I really really liked!  I bought a lot of music
  and spent a while reviewing it &mdash; but also, this year, I even did some
  mixes and mashups of my own, so stick around for those.</p>
  
  <p>As usual, here's how this works: the rating system is relative and
  subjective rating system, from one to five stars.  A one star album is
  not, necessarily, bad (unless I say it is...) &mdash; think of it, really, as
  how much I am excited about listening to something, so one star just might
  mean that I haven't really found a place for it in my regular listening
  habits.  The more stars, the more I think other people will want to listen
  to it too &mdash; or, at least, the more I think other people ought to listen
  to it, anyway...!</p>
  
  <p>Got it?  Okay, well, let's get started &mdash; this year, I bought 22
  albums, made 4 mashups of my own, saw 4 live shows, and recommended
  another additional 26 pieces of "extra credit", and here they all are:</p>

    <p>Electronica; nominally trance, but not definitively.  Recommended for
    everyone.  <b>Drop what you're doing and buy this album right now.</b></p>
    
    <p>I heard that this was happening because I just happened to tune into
    Above &amp; Beyond's radio show, where G&amp;D were doing a guest mix to
    promote their new album.  <i>I'm sorry, wait, a G&amp;D new album???</i>
    I picked it up at the beginning of the year, and as I alluded to in last
    year's review, I absolutely loved it.  I'm glad I didn't discover this
    in 2017, really: I would have hated to have to decide between this and
    <i>Escape</i> as my favorite album from 2017!</p>
    
    <p>This album reads as a continuous mix, and I love it as a coherent
    unit.  Like albums that I've fallen in love with in the past, it
    explores a wide range of content and a wide range of feelings in the
    soundscapes that it puts together.  It starts as what feels like is
    going to be a trance DJ set with <i>Only Road</i>, and that's okay, but
    the style shifts all over the place, with Gabriel &amp; Dresden's
    trademark detuned synths showing up in <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4qVuljO-Nw">This Love Kills
    Me</a></i>, and an almost New Order-like sound in the verse (such as it
    is) in <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK-aMfUdNz8">You</a></i>.  It's
    difficult to describe the true expanse that this album covers without
    going into almost every song on it; it's almost a disservice to the
    album to have to pick only a few tracks to get a feel of what it is, but
    the linked ones represent at least a few corners of it.</p>
    
    <p><i>Two tracks from this album ended up on my <a
    href="https://joshuawise.com/resources/eoy2018/v1/">end of year

    <p>Classical.</p>
    
    <p>Ari Mason, who you may remember from 2016's collection of almost
    EBM-style tunes, is evolving as an artist, and she spent much of 2018
    changing around her sound.  A lot of the rest of what she did in 2018
    had an R&amp;B feel.  But this, on the other hand, is something else:
    she decided to cover a bunch of 16th century motets.  Reportedly,
    despite the sound, none of the recording uses a vocoder, which is quite surprising indeed!</p>
    
    <p>In the "extra credit" notes from last year, I wrote: "But I'm really
    excited to see an artist finding her sound, and making such a strong
    statement: "this is what I believe that this genre should draw from",
    and "it's okay to have crosspollination in our influences".  This is a
    gutsy album to release, and I'm so glad that she did it." I stand by
    that: I'm not convinced that this is something that everyone has to buy,
    but if you liked Ari Mason's previous work, this is an interesting and
    very different view on what is clearly quite a lot of musical
    talent.</p>

    <p>Trance, or, uh, as trancey as 125bpm gets.  Buy if you liked <i>We
    Are All We Need</i>; everyone else can skip.</p>
    
    <p>Yep, it's a modern Above &amp; Beyond album, I guess.  To be honest,
    I am not super enamored with Above &amp; Beyond's productions these
    days: they all seem to have the same flavor, and that flavor is not
    really what I want.  It's either commercialized trouse that all sounds
    the same, or messy big room disasters that all have the same drop.  I
    keep buying it, because I loved <i>Tri-State</i>, and I know there will
    be a few tracks that I will love, but it kind of gives me the same
    feeling that I got from Gareth Emery's <i>100 Reasons To Live</i>: it
    feels like they turned the crank and just churned out another one.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, there are some good tracks on there.  <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUFBQqhxR8c">Sahara Love</a></i>
    tickles some specially joyful bits of beats in my head, and I really do
    occasionally keep hearing Zo&euml; Johnston's voice echoing in <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZALrv7eMWbs">Always</a></i> in my
    head, so those are maybe highlights to listen to if you'd like.</p>

    <p>Chill-verging-on-ambient that wraps its tendrils around you. 
    Recommend if that intrigues you instead of scaring you.</p>
    
    <p>This album is a great way to get completely and totally lost in
    soundscapes that collide directly with lyrics that verge somewhere
    between "abstract" and "sharp and pointed".  I knew of Lamb originally
    from a remix of one of their songs &mdash; <i>Trans Fatty Acid (K&amp;D
    Session)</i> &mdash; but I think something from this album got suggested to
    me by YouTube, of all places.  (Maybe it got bored of recommending Nazis
    and decided to try doing some actual good in the world for once.) This
    album stays largely in its own little corner of truly intense sounds,
    but it varies some within, ranging from <i>Nobody Else</i> &mdash; a 6/8
    ballad &mdash; to <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do7RUIDqRJE">What Makes Us
    Human</a></i>, which seems resistant to any particular analysis of
    rhythm at all.  The sweeping synths seem to want to grip you and pull
    you every which way; I found it to be quite rewarding to let them.</p>

    <p>Dark ambient.</p>
    
    <p>I think I was looking for music for my yoga class for World Goth Day,
    and, well, I got it.  I was searching, and I think, I must've found the
    track <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEswr2dduE&list=OLAK5uy_mgoucgj57aJvVIn3-mzL1vtDh7DGEYYMk&index=10">Gothic
    Yoga</a></i>, which I think is <i>definitely</i> a representative track
    of what you'll get on this album.  It is 100% as weird as advertised.</p>
    
    <p>Ambient ain't usually my thing, but if it's yours, I think this might
    be pretty decent ...  you'll have to let me know.  It might be good
    background noise while you're working; I'll have to try it for that.</p>

    <p>Mix CD: trance, etc.  Recommend for people interested in that kind of
    thing.</p>
    
    <p>I don't usually get mix CDs, but I definitely don't regret getting
    this.  This is a 3CD with mixes each from Markus Schulz, Gabriel &amp;
    Dresden, and Andy Moor &mdash; each of which, in their own right, is a huge
    and historic name in trance.  All of that is amplified by the fact that
    <i>ISOS</i> is also a compilation with a real history behind it;
    Ti&euml;sto did the first seven, for instance, and had a history of
    putting remixes that are now considered "the standard" on a bunch of
    them.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, this mix seems to have offered each of those three artists an
    opportunity to compose an answer to the question, &ldquo;what do you
    think trance ought to sound like in 2018?&rdquo; &mdash; and each of the
    three has their own subtly different answer.  I think this compilation
    is a great, and fairly definitive, set of perspectives, and if you find
    yourself interested in that question, you probably owe it to yourself to
    listen to the answers from these three artists.</p>

    <p>Trance.  Even a little dark!  Recommend if you liked <i>Pure</i>, or
    for trance fans.</p>
    
    <p>Ever since Solarstone released <i>Pure</i> in 2012, I've kind of
    hoped he would do another artist album.  I'm not sure how I ended up
    finding that he <i>did</i> &mdash; but I'm glad he did, because this feels
    like a worthy follow-up.  It feels like it trends a little more
    melancholy than <i>Pure</i>, but on the other hand, maybe I do too &mdash;
    and it certainly retains that uplifting Solarstone base, if you know
    where to look for it, after all.  <i>.----</i> (morse code for "1") is
    only eight tracks long, but I think that goes a long way to help the
    album avoid overstaying its welcome; Solarstone had about eight tracks
    of good ideas, and so he released only that much music.</p>
    
    <p>If you like, for instance, <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPW-9ZKIY7Q">I Found You</a></i>
    (featuring Meredith Call) or <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix7kzitFkTc">Choosing His
    Angels</a></i> (featuring Alex Karweit), you'll probably like the rest of <i>.----</i>.  I sure do, anyway.</p>

    <p>Trance.</p>
    
    <p>This is, in theory, the successor album to <i>.----</i>.  It has some
    solid tracks on it, but it doesn't feel as coherent as its predecessor. 
    It has a little of the "turning the crank" feel, but mostly my claim is
    that it has a bunch of okay tracks, but no really great ones.  It's not
    an active disappointment, but it kind of feels like a no-op.  If you
    want some more Solarstone, <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIbhbA65BdI">Midsummer

    <p>De/Vision seems like they have an even/odd cadence of "good album",
    "bad album".  Unfortunately for me, this album seems like it falls into
    the "odd" cadence.  I am used to driving, compelling rhythms, with big
    synths to back them up; I found this album to be, rhythmically,
    uninteresting, and I generally felt myself uncompelled to move my body
    in response.  I think I only listened to it once or twice, and I don't
    remember much of it; representative, maybe, is <i><a

    <p>I was kind of upset with the De/Vision album mentioned above, because
    I knew it could be better be than what it was.  I rated this the same
    because I listen to it about the same amount, but I like it better as an
    artistic statement: I think what I learned from this album is not that
    "ohGr's composition is bad", but that "I don't really categorically love
    ohGr".  ohGr has had his moments in the past for me (<i>wateR</i> is a
    track that has stuck in my mind for a good long while), but none of this
    really made me stick around such that I want to replay it.  But all that
    said, I at least can name a track that I like from this album, and it is
    the title track, <i><a

    <p>Synth......something.  Recommend for Ashbury Heights fans or people
    who want something <i>just plain weird</i>.</p>
    
    <p>I have absolutely no idea what is going on in this album and I'm kind
    of here for it.  Ashbury Heights have a very synthpop-ish legacy, but
    this album solidly went in the direction of "whatever the hell Anders
    Hagstr&ouml;m wants, because he has been around too long to put up with
    whatever your thoughts are on what he should write".  So the result is
    something completely off the wall; it starts with <i>Headlights</i> at
    155+bpm, moving into an almost Gareth Emery-feeling track, through an
    almost French House-style gated compressor, all the way through
    <i>Waiting For The Fall</i> with a Groove Coverage kind of feeling... 
    it's all so weird, but the secret is that I actually love all of those
    sounds.  I vacillate between feeling that the whole thing is way over
    the top, and feeling that it's exactly what I want; maybe the two
    feelings actually coexist better than I had thought!</p>
    
    <p>I have no idea what to recommend as "representative" tracks.  Maybe
    <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kYqpp4NmL4">Journey</a></i>
    is one extreme, and <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsz3pbhpCac">Headlights</a></i> is
    on the other side, but there's a lot of weird stuff everywhere in the
    middle.</p>

    <p>Synthpop.  Trip-hop.  Recommend for synthpop and dark electronic
    fans.</p>
    
    <p>Helix is one of Tom Shear (Assemblage 23)'s many side projects, this
    time formed alongside vocalist Mari Kattman.  I've been ambivalent on
    some of Tom's other side projects, but I <i>really</i> like the
    combination that resulted.  It feels like a fresh view on a lot of the
    themes of his work, and more than that, it's an opportunity to let
    someone else bring the strengths of their vocals on top of what I think
    Tom really does best &mdash; putting down communicative and engrossing drum
    sequences and synths.  As a change, not everything on the album is
    something that necessarily makes you gyrate and dance (though it does
    have its moments!), but instead there are some more pensive
    opportunities, and unusually for A23-associated work, they don't seem to
    drag along.</p>
    
    <p>If you like A23's stuff, this is a logical place to go.  But the
    interesting thing, I think, is even for people who don't necessarily
    like Tom Shear's previous work, there might well be something for you. 
    There's something to this album that seems familiar, but at the same
    time, there's a whole new range of sounds that just don't fit the
    Assemblage 23 name &mdash; and I'm glad that Tom Shear is exploring them here
    anyway.  Representative, maybe, is the dancy-feeling <i><a
    href="https://helix.bandcamp.com/track/bird-of-prey">Bird of
    Prey</a></i>, and the slower, chilled trip-hop feeling of <i><a

    Wrong</a></i>.</p>
    
    <p><i>&ldquo;Bird of Prey&rdquo;, from this album, ended up on my <a

    <p>I had kind of forgotten about Solitary Experiments, but I know them

    this float by on YouTube, and I had planned to include it on my yearmix,
    so I bought it, and actually, the rest of the single is basically worth
    it, too!  My big complaint about this is that it's just mastered way too
    hot, but musically, Crash &amp; Burn just seems to tickle all of the
    bits that really get make me get way into synthpop.  The remixes on the
    album, also, are a total riot &mdash; if you couldn't get enough of the

    <p>EDM, verging on dubstep.  Recommended, even if you normally look at
    the word "dubstep" and run the other direction.</p>
    
    <p>To be honest, the only reason this isn't getting a 5 from me for this
    year is that there are already <i>three!</i> other albums that get 5s. 
    But this is a really great four-track EP.  It's crafted as something of
    a concept album, and at least flows intentionally from track to track;
    it feels like a shaped narrative of feelings, which always resonates
    with me.  Even the track in the middle that I stylistically like least
    &mdash; <i>After Dark</i> &mdash; I understand why it "needs to be there" for the
    purpose of the album, and I respect it.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe part of why I like this album is that it came at the right
    time.  It kept popping up in my playlist during a few months of a
    horribly rough phase of a relationship, and felt like it was asking some
    of the same questions I was asking myself.  <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oirlCoi3iCM">Start Again</a></i>
    felt like it prodded at the same edge of giving up versus trying again
    that I kept finding myself on the corner of ...  and the enormous chords
    of <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJLmTPeBnk">Dreamin'</a></i> were
    a beacon in the darkness, as this counterpoint and resolution to the
    tension that the rest of the album builds up.  I found this to be one of
    the most refreshing and honest takes on "modern EDM" that I'd heard in a
    while; at just 22 minutes, I think it's worth a listen through for most
    people.</p>

    <p>Rock.  <b>Buy this album.</b></p>
    
    <p>I have liked Metric's work for a while.  Fantasies and Synthetica
    have their catchy moments; Pagans in Vegas was okay, too, I suppose. 
    One of the things that I really enjoy, though, is Emily Haines's style
    of songwriting &mdash; what feels like almost an unfiltered reflection of her
    psyche, in a way that seems pretty rare.  Art of Doubt doubles down on
    this, lyrically getting even deeper than I remember from any previous
    Metric albums, and as the album title suggest, touching on themes of
    uncertainty that feel like they've been glossed over in her past work.</p>
    
    <p>Art of Doubt starts off with a proper "stadium rock" feeling to it,
    and that's the tone of the first half of the album.  <i>Risk</i> feels
    like a pivot point in the album's energy into a more reflective phase,
    from feelings and tones into a more explicitly experiential view.  The
    first half sticks in my head more, to be sure, but I'm not sure this is
    a knock on the second half &mdash; the second half feels almost like a
    necessary come-down, just as a way of reminding the listener that it's
    all true to what feels like reality for Emily Haines.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, I think everyone should just listen to this album cover to
    cover, probably on a road trip or something.  But if you can't do that,
    have a listen to <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1ej6O9ZPEE">Underline the
    Black</a></i> and <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC8MfulGMXE">Now or Never

    <p>Free jazz.   Afro-futurism.  <b>Buy this album.</b></p>
    
    <p>I do not get to listen to enough modern jazz, really, and this album
    feels like what I needed as an antidote to that.  The general thesis of
    this double (!) album is simple, and it goes like this: the first CD is
    "Earth", a gritty view onto this world we live in, as separate from
    Washington's view of the Divine &mdash; and the second CD is "Heaven", an
    almost Messianic view of a perfect world, and the calling that takes us
    there.  In some ways, these two themes are overt in presentation; the
    first track on the first CD, <i>Fists of Fury</i>, explicitly presents a
    message of Black empowerment in its lyrics, while <i>Vi Lua, Vi Sol</i>
    off of the second album is a ballad of love from a creator to all of
    creation.  But in other was, the themes hide in sounds and tones: the
    almost frenzied feel to <i>Connections</i> (off the first disc)
    contrasts directly with the feeling of transcendence associated with
    <i>The Space Travelers Lullaby</i>, which opens up the second disc &mdash;
    even though both have no lyrics to speak of.</p>
    
    <p>One comparison I find myself making is with John Coltrane's <i>A Love
    Supreme</i>, a four part investigation also into Coltrane's connection
    with divinity.  Coltrane tries a bunch of ways to get his message across
    &mdash; lyrics, an almost mantra-like repetition of a phrase, and sounds &mdash;
    and they all play off each other in the hope that one will stick. 
    Washington takes a similar tack, both in the general sorts of questions
    that he asks with his inquiry, and also with how he goes about it.  In
    some ways, Washington's work is more accessible than Coltrane's: it has
    lyrics and rhythms that are aligned more closely with what our modern
    ears seem to understand and expect, and so it's often more familiar.  In
    other ways, it's less accessible: while Coltrane makes his point in four
    tracks lasting just over half an hour, Washington explores the subject
    matter for almost two and a half hours.  But the familiarity that the
    modern sounds bring to it, I think, compensate for that: more often than
    not, I found myself thinking "aha!  I understand what he's doing here",
    and suddenly excited about a new twist or turn that he had taken.  I
    found myself basically captivated for the entire duration of my first
    listen-through &mdash; no mean feat for such a long work!</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, I think everyone should listen to this.  This album feels
    like a definitional moment for "what jazz should be in 2018".  If you
    can't listen to all of it, <i>Fists of Fury</i> (not on YouTube, but <a
    href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3E8nzNloeto0X4PStdQwQA?autoplay=true&v=T">Spotify</a>,

    <p>EBM, or futurepop, or whatever VNV Nation is.  Buy for VNV
    completionists; everyone else can probably skip.</p>
    
    <p>Noire is VNV's first album that's just Ronan Harris, after Mark
    Jackson left the band.  It's like an hour and 13 minutes, and there's
    just no need for it to be that long.  Each song goes on at least a
    minute longer than Ronan had ideas, so my conclusion is that Mark
    Jackson was the one who held the trimming tool in his hand.  Since the
    album is so damned long, I'll try to be brief.</p>
    
    <p>There are a few good tracks on it with good ideas, and a few that
    even stick out in my mind.  All of them just feel too damn long, though. 
    Anyway, the track you're looking for is <i><a

    <p>Futurepop.  EBM.  Recommend for fans of the genre.</p>
    
    <p>I think that the best description of this 2CD for me is that
    <i>Future Tense</i> is the album that I really wanted <i>Noire</i> to
    be.  Although it mostly settles on a theme that feels a lot like the
    lead single, <i>Crash &amp; Burn</i>, it's, anyway, not exactly 12
    tracks of the same song over and over again; it has its share of
    ballads, and different rhythms to shake things up a little, even if the
    instrumentation is fairly similar from track to track.  As a whole,
    though, the album comes at you like a train, with <i>I Am</i> totally
    unstoppable in its unlifting synths.  (As a bonus, you get a second side
    full of remixes, which are often interesting views on the original
    tracks.) My biggest pet peeve is that the album is mastered hot as hell,
    to the point that some of the tracks sound clipped, which seems like a
    frustratingly unnecessary strike against an otherwise very solid
    album.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6aU3mS_CaE"><i>Every
    Time</i></a> is a good introduction to the harmonies and soaring synths
    that you'll find on the album, and <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeZxi8vlgdM"><i>Shelter</i></a> is
    a counterpoint of something more ballad-like; if you like these, you'll
    like the rest of the album.</p>

    <p>Rock (paranoid).  Recommend for Muse completionists.</p>
    
    <p>There's a new Muse album.  It seems to happen every year or two. 
    And, really, there's basically one big problem with that &mdash; well,
    actually, there are three big problems, and they are <i>Origin of
    Symmetry</i>, <i>Absolution</i>, and <i>Black Holes &amp;
    Revelations</i>.  The basic issue is that Muse, more or less, keep
    making the same album, but every time they do, it's not as good as the
    last time they made the same album.  Occasionally they have shaken it up
    &mdash; <i>Resistance</i> was something that was totally different than Old
    Muse, and <i>2nd Law</i> was something that was just straight up bad
    even if you don't compare it to their other albums, but the biggest
    problem with <i>Simulation Theory</i> is that Matt Bellamy doesn't
    really say anything in it that he didn't say better in the past.</p>
    
    <p>So I guess what I'm saying is that <i>Simulation Theory</i> isn't
    really a <i>bad</i> album, per se [1] ... but I just don't see a whole lot
    of reason for it to exist.  It has a handful of good tracks, and I'd
    even say that there are more good tracks than there are bad ones.  But
    even the best of them are good mostly for gag value, rather than for
    anything else about them (and Muse seem to implicitly acknowledge this,
    for instance, by commissioning the UCLA Bruin Marching Band to do an <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1lUUX9IPvg">official cover of
    <i>Pressure</i></a>!).  Not a whole lot of it sticks out in my head;
    maybe that's because I've been trending away from rock, or maybe it's
    because I've been trending away from Muse's sound, or maybe it's just
    because it feels unremarkable, but either way, it's hard to know
    which.</p>
    
    <p>Anwyay, probably one of my favorite tracks on the album is <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azAEHCQgcUI"><i>Something
    Human</i></a> ...  and if you want to have a good laugh, click through
    to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4ozdiGys5g"><i>Dick
    Town</i></a>, all the while with the knowledge that I have primed your
    brain with that phrase.</p>
    
    <p><small>[1] Just as I finished writing this, I did realize that I
    wanted to call out one thing I heard on the album that kind of
    explicitly bothered me.  Muse, and Bellamy, have always enjoyed speaking
    of conspiracy theories and generally topics of paranoia and otherworldly
    control.  <i>Thought Contagion</i> echoes some of these themes of social
    control, but one lyric in the chorus, "<i>...brace for the final
    solution...</i>" feels particularly ill-conceived.  The song is unclear
    in its intent, and can be read either as a warning of the rise of
    fascism (and, therefore, an anti-fascist call to action, with a claim of
    the consequence) &mdash; or it can be read as a claim that the "thought
    contagion" is something that can be <i>cleansed</i> with a "final
    solution" (and, therefore, an anti-semitic call to action!).  I
    generally read the message as the former, and so that doesn't stop me
    from recommending the album ...  but all that said, Matt Bellamy is no
    fool, and really ought to have known better than that.</small></p>

    <p>Trance.</p>
    
    <p>Kyau &amp; Albert is one of those old-school trance names from when I
    started listening to trance, so when I saw that they had released an
    artist album, I was excited.  Unfortunately, not a whole lot on it
    really stuck out in my head.  I guess it was good background music when
    I was working when I listened through it, but only one track was really
    remarkable, and that was <i><a
    href="https://soundcloud.com/kyauandalbert/dont-need-a-lesson">Don't
    Need a Lesson</a></i>.  I guess the track that followed it, <i><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcKewwV2UYA">Airy</a></i>, is a
    cool instrumental too that I could see being the soundtrack to
    something.  The rest you can safely skip.</p>

  act: "So Stoked: Rave to the Grave II (ft. Daniel Graves of Aesthetic Perfection and Kyau &amp; Albert)"
  where: DNA Lounge
  date: January 26th

    An unusual combination of two people in the same room; DJ sets from
    both.  I liked the trancey sets more than I liked Daniel Graves's.  I
    also ran into <a href="https://joshua0.dreamwidth.org/65051.html">an
    interesting character and had a kind of surreal moment</a>.

    Yep, it's Mushroom.  Some live band, but a lot of "psytrance karaoke":
    there's a lot of DAT deck, and not a lot of live music happening, I
    found.  <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/A3wxSwidqCXYyoZs6">Photos.</a>
